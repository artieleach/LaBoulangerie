I'm tired of feeling SMALL, so SMALL, you know? I'm not NOTHING, but I'm also not quite ENOUGH.
[do you mean small literally?]
Well YES but, I don't mind being little, I want everyone to be my size, I don't want to get any bigger.
[when do you feel large?]
    Couple of moons ago, I told a real banger of a joke, and they all laughed and laughed, everyone thought I was real hot stuff.
    [Where are your friends now?]
        I don't see em much. They keep looking me over, I guess. Like I said, I'm too small.
    [Did you think your joke was funny?]
        Everyone laughed, didn't they?
        [So what really mattered, the joke or the laughter?]
            The laughter, I guess.
            [But you weren't laughing]
                Yeah, well, it didn't matter then, why should it matter now?
                
    [Why did that make you feel large?]
        I didn't feel large, I was large. 
[lemme whip something up for you]

possible potions:
    potion of laughter
    potion of increase size
    potion of telekinesis

A conman planning on robbing the town. hell come in every day until you have to decide in the end to help him or not
Ah, the town witch! Every town has a witch and every witch has a town. Love the symbiosis in that.
[What can I do for you today?]
    I just rolled into your fine little neck of the woods. It's charming here, charming! But I gotta couple of questions. Think you can clear some confusion in this head of mine?
    [How may I be of service?]
        Thats's a friend. Well I wanted to know why your town felt the way it did. Like There's something not quite right about it. Any ideas?
        [What makes you say that?]
            
        [Have you not noticed something similiar in other towns?]
            
        [Why must that fall on the town?]
            Ain't that a trick? You view this town as a collective, as a single being, and one that you're not part of. 
            [Do you need something from me?]
    [I don't sell information, I sell potions.]
        Of course, of course! My apologies. Then I've got a real pill for you, but I'm sure you're up to it. I 
[Have you been to many towns?]
    I've been here and there. Been around enough to make my way, where ever I go.
[Symbiosis?]
    Yeah, yeah! Let's say you're a mayor and your town's got problems, real problems. What do you do?
    [Talk to my advisors]  # all of these need to be exhausted before the next optio appears
        Very astute! Have you always been a witch? Alright you talk to them, and there's no hope. What now?
    [Cure the problems at their source]  # all of these need to be exhausted before the next optio appears
        Strongheaded, I could tell as soon as I walked in that I would like you. But these problems aren't the kind you can sweep under the rug, no matter how magic the broom is.
    [Unify my residents against the threat]  # all of these need to be exhausted before the next optio appears
        A born leader, through and through. But what are you gonna do when the problem is bigger than your rinkydink town?
    [I see there's no course to victory. What now?]  # only appears once the previous options were chosen.
        You know when to cut your losses, another thing we have in common. Well you need a scape goat.
        [I see, and the townwitch is the perfect scapegoat, of course.]
            You said it, not me.
            [That seems more predatorial than symbiotic]
                Your tongue is as golden as your appearance. But think of your life before you had a town. What did you do to get by?
                [That's none of your business.]
                    Ah, cmon, we're friends now! Thick as thieves. But fine, I'll relent. Anyway symbiosis doesn't always last, sometime's it's just a year, a month, a...
                [I've played enough of your games, do you need my help or not?]
                    I do need your help, I got a real thorn in my side.
                [I did the same that any of us would do.]
                    Wouldn't expect any less from one of your type. So precise. Like I said, one town, one witch. Always, always.
