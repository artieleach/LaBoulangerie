# La Boulangerie: The Server: The Cafe: The Videogame: Episode 1: Part 1: The Beginning
Cafe games for my friends on da bes server  
You may be wondering why there are so many bugs and why the game doesn't have a
proper ending, this is because I'm bad at programming and. hope that clears
everything up!

## About the game:  
You work at a mood cafe. Folks come in, tell you how theyre feeling and what's going on in thier lives. 
You make them a drink based on how they feel. 
There's no overarching narritive, no real ending. 
It's just a cafe gig, like you had when you were younger.
