add conversational mechanic to hint at ingredients
leave it up to the player to figure out what goes where
e.e "i need something to steel my resolve", include a passage in 
an ingredient about strengthening resolve


each potion has three ingredients, so there needs to be three conversational hints about what potion to make

when a key conversational piece pops up, allow it to be clicked to get a card
