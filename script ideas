hey, what do you usually give someone to drink when theyre having a bad day? I'll take one of those.

do you ever love something, like really love something, then realize that you changed so much, that you don't love it anymore?

I feel like the party's over, like I'm waking up in the morning, hungover, and surrounded by the proof that fun was had, but is no longer being had.



A)Hey, what's your witchiest drink? I've been trying practical magick and I need to get into the right mindset.
Magick really fun, you get to find out a lot about yourself. 
I was worried it was going to be all "how to have a demon do your taxes!" but it's not.
It's about your relationship to your own mind, or at least it is for me.

B)Hi again. I think I'm getting better at this magick stuff, I have a much better awareness of self.
Could I get the same thing as last time, please?

C)Hi, my usual please. I had some hard realizations while meditating last night. I think I know who I am now.
Do you know who you are?



A)This place is a coffee shop now? It was when I was a kid too, but that was ages ago. 
How long have you guys been here?
I know this is a stretch, but do you have the same secret menu? Could I get a Zeldan Sky?
The more things change, the more they stay the same. This is just like I remember.

B)


Could I get something to help me study? Lots of that stuff.

Do people know how to study? I don't.



Does your brain ever feel empty? Like you're just regurgitating what you've learned? Do you have a drink to fill my brain up?
